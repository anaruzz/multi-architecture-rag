Final Answer:
  To configure a VLAN on a Cisco switch, you need to follow these steps:

1. Enter privileged EXEC mode by entering the command `enable` or `enable secret`.
2. Access global configuration mode by typing `configure terminal`.
3. Create a new VLAN using the `vlan <vlan-id>` command. For example, `vlan 10`.
4. Enter VLAN configuration mode with the `exit` command.
5. Configure additional parameters such as VLAN name and access ports associated with the VLAN.
6. Save your changes using the `write memory` or `copy running-config startup-config` command.

Chapter 12  ACLs 
This chapter compares the commands for configuring access control lists (ACLs).  
An ACL is a list of one or more access control entries (ACEs) specifying the criteria the switch uses to 
either permit (forward) or deny (drop) the IP packets traversing the switch’s interfaces. 
This chapter covers ACL basics, creating ACLs, applying ACLs for routing/Layer 3 operations, applying 
ACLs for VLAN/Layer 2 operations, and applying ACLs for port/interface controls.

Context 8:
Configuring and Applying Access Control Lists
An access control list (ACL)  is a set of rules used to limit access to a particular interface (for example, 
if you want to restrict a wireless client from pinging the management interface of the controller). After 
ACLs are configured on the controll er, they can be applied to the management interface, the AP-manager 
interface, any of the dynamic interfaces, or a WLAN to control data traffic to and from wireless clients

• vlan <vlan-id> ip address <ip-address>/<mask-length>
• vlan <vlan-id> ip address <ip-address> <mask-bits>
• vlan <vlan-id> ip address <dhcp-bootp>
You must either include the ID of the VLAN for which you are configuring IP addressing or go to the context
configuration level for that VLAN. (If you are not using VLANs on the switch—that is, if the only VLAN is the
default VLAN—then the VLAN ID is always "1".) I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: To configure a VLAN on a Cisco switch, you can follow these steps from the search_docs observation:

1. Begin in privileged EXEC mode.
2. Use config-vlan mode to create or modify an Ethernet VLAN by entering the command "configure terminal vlan <vlan-id>".
3. Name the VLAN (e.g., "name test20").
4. Add the VLAN to the VLAN database using the command "exit".
5. Return the VLAN name to default settings if needed, using commands like "no name" or "no mtu".

For configuring a dynamic interface, follow these steps:
1. Enter the Interfaces > New Page and enter an interface name and VLAN identifier.
2. Click Apply to commit your changes.
3. Configure the following parameters on the Interfaces > Edit page:
